# Quide

Qt **Qui**ck **D**esktop **E**nviroment,

is a shell configuration similar to a Desktop Enviroment which is more in the direction of nwg-shell in terms of scope. 
It's still quite early in the development and above all tailored to my use and not really intended as a program for everyone. 

>[!WARNING]
>For the config to work properly, you also need the appropriate scripts and hyprland configuration which are not in this repository!
